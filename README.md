# Medical_Expenses_Prediction
*PREDICT THE FUTURE MEDICAL EXPENSES OF PATIENTS USING LINEAR REGRESSION, RANDOM FOREST, AND GRADIENT BOOSTING*
- Predict the future medical expenses of patients based on specific features.
- Factors affecting the medical expenses of the patients:-
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Body Mass Index
   - Region
   - Smoking Behaviour	
   
- [x] Univariate Analysis
  - Only one variable is involved. 
  - It's used to figure out how the variables in the dataset are distributed and to extract useful data from them.
  - It can be used to examine both numerical and categorical variable distributions.
  
- [x] Bivariate Analysis
  + One of the most basic types of quantitative analysis is Bivariate analysis.
  + It entails analyzing two variables in order to determine their empirical relationship.
  + It can be useful for testing simple association hypotheses.

- [x] Feature Scaling
  + Feature scaling is a technique for normalizing a set of independent variables or data features.
  + Data Normalization is another name for feature scaling. 
  + It helps in the normalization of data within a particular range.
  + It also helps in the speeding of algorithmic calculations.
  
  - [x] Linear Regression
    + A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent and one or more independent variables is known as linear regression.
    + The dependent and independent variables must have a linear relationship. 
    + Two variables must have trend lines that are either increasing or decreasing.
    + In statistical terminology, all variables must have the same variance.
